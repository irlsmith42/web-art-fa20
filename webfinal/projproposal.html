    <h1>Part 1</h1>
    <p>
        Since just about the start of quarantine, I have been working on an investigative internet podcast, working title "Searching for CWR." It's about me and a friend, separated by the quarantine, searching for a fanfiction writer who we love, who had a cult following until she vanished from the internet. The podcast is in its early production stages, but it will eventually need a website, and I would like to start working on a landing/homepage for it. For now, this will just be one project/page, but I will set up the skeleton of the other webpages (and leave them empty).
        <br>
        The story starts in British Columbia, on a farm in the middle of the woods, and then the rest of it takes place on the internet; my visual art practice involves multimedia drawing/collage, which I would really like to experiment with digitally. My favorite assignment so far in this semester (my first webpage, a la Cameron's World) gave me ideas. I want to explore a similar collage-type page, with elements of "web aesthetics" dating from 90s fan forums to now, situated in the hills and woods of the BC farm. I imagine it looking kind of like a middle-schooler's over-decorated journal, but in web form. Other elements I'd like to include are a loading animation, a countdown clock (to release?), a timeline, a player for the preview clip,  and menu items (which would not lead anywhere yet). Like a book cover, it should be allusive rather than informative; things that look intriguing, but don't explain what's going on in the podcast unless you've listened.

    <h1>Part 2</h1>
    <p>I hope to get better at page design & implementation of something with a lot of layers and placing those layers/visual elements, making them look nice and work together on any screen. My pimary concern is making something visually interesting but also clear, i.e. effective information presentation/communication. It will be interactive, but only a little bit.

    <h1>Part 3</h1>
    <p>Technical: loading screen delayed action; javascript countdown; menu buttons/items & associated page hierarchy; embedded audui player. At my current ability, I think I could make this, given enough hours, but it will just need a lot of troubleshooting/debugging.</p>
