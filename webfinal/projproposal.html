    <h1>Final Project Proposal</h1>
    <h2>Part 1</h2>
    <p>
        Since just about the start of quarantine, I have been working on an investigative podcast, working title "Searching for CWR." It's the story of me and my friend Sasha, separated by the quarantine, searching for a fanfiction writer whom we love. "CWR" (real name unknown) wrote a long, dense, overly-researched fic about the movie Pacific Rim, and it got wildly popular, gaining a cult following -- her story spawned an audiobook, a 2-hour radio play, and a <em>band</em>, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxXwBrNCtVFPaQbmugtzeDQ">Superconducting Supercolliders</a>. Then, one day, she took everything down, and vanished from the Internet. 
        <br><br>
        This podcast is in its early production stages, but it will eventually need a website, and I would like to start working on a landing/homepage for it. For now, this will just be one project/page, but I will set up the skeleton of the other webpages (and leave them empty).
        <br><br>
        This story is set on the Internet, in Chicago, and in British Columbia, Canada. It starts in BC, on a farm where Sasha and I worked together for a summer, so since the story is anchored there, I'd like the webpage design to combine that setting + the "online"/virtual setting. Since it's a story about the history of fandom, spanning the 90s to today, and the perils of the Web 2.0 social media hivemind, I'd also like to engage with that history and work with Web 1.0 visual elements/structures, Geocities/fanpages/forums/etc. Like a book cover, it should be allusive rather than informative; things that look intriguing, but don't explain what's going on in the podcast unless you've listened. 
        <br><br>
        My own visual art practice involves multimedia drawing/collage. I would really like to experiment with that digitally. My favorite assignment so far in this semester was my first webpage. I want to explore a similar collage-type page for this, situating the web elements in the hills and woods of the BC farm. I imagine it looking kind of like a middle-schooler's over-decorated journal, but in web form. 
        <br><br>Other elements I'd like to include are a loading animation, a countdown clock (to release?), a timeline, a player for the preview clip, and menu items (which would not lead anywhere yet).
    </p>
    <h2>Part 2</h2>
    <p>I hope to get better at page design & implementation of something with a lot of layers and placing those layers/visual elements, making them work together on any screen. My pimary concern is making something visually interesting but also clear, i.e. effective information presentation/communication. It will be interactive, but only a little bit.

    <h2>Part 3</h2>
    <p>Technical elements: loading screen delayed action; javascript countdown; menu buttons/items & associated page hierarchy; embedded audui player. 
    <br><br>At my current ability, I think I could make this, given enough hours, but it will just need a lot of troubleshooting/debugging/fussing.</p>
